    Splurty is a web app that randomly splurts out quotes from the hit TV series Game of Thrones. This app, built using Ruby on Rails, marks my beginning steps into the world of web development.

      I am an aspiring web developer who has been addicted to reading and learning about web technologies ever since the day I picked up a beginner's book about HTML and CSS to help out a friend. I am currently on my path to becoming a full-stack developer, coding and hacking away with the <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com">Firehose Project</a>.
